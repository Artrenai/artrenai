## Milestone 1 Feedback
Nice work on the Persona - this is much better. Putting this thought towards the users you want to target will help you make important decisions about your design, layout, and content choices going forward in Milestone 2a. Always keep your target audience in mind, what their needs and goals are, and YOUR goals for your website and your photography business. This is a great direction, and as someone who once worked in photo I'm really looking forward to what your design ideas are. :-)

There are still some points here that aren't quite 100% correct... the Use Case still doesn't address _how your Persona will use the website_. I do want to say that What you have in your Use Case is *great* because it speaks about your goals for the project in detail... but that should go in the "Goals" section above. 

I think maybe the users who visit your site would probably want to see a gallery of your work, and maybe might want a link to your Instagram account before they send you a DM either through social media or your contact form. Just some quick thoughts on your Use Case.

I think you definitely understand the direction and goals for your project and the users/clients you are looking for.  I think you're ready to move forward with Milestone 2a. I also think you'll definitely need an interactive gallery that is touch and swipe friendly... and I can help you with that.

Your project is set up right, and your HTML is looking good. There were a couple of very minor technical issues I wanted to point out, see Edits &amp; Suggestions below.

Your Milestone 1 passes at [Tier I](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/) - but please move forward with Milestone 2a now because of time. Please also have a good look at the documentation and sample milestone here for examples on what we're looking for:

- https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/milestone-two/
- https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/example/

### Edits &amp; Suggestions
- Missing `<meta charset="utf-8">` tag
- Recommended that you use the `target="_blank"` attribute on links that lead to an external web page. This attribute will open the link in a new tab.
- Line 1 should be `.DS_Store` in your .gitignore
