		<h2>Content Strategy</h2>
		<p>The essentials will have to be the header and footer. In the header will be the navigation menu which will consist of </p>
			<ul>
			<li>Bio</li>
			<li>Portfiolio
				<ul>
					<li>Photography</li>
					<li>Edits and Manipulation</li>
					<li>Experimental</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Contact</li>
		</ul>
			<p>Allot of the website will be as graphical as possible. Its important that the page is palpable.Thinking mobile first,
		 	this has to translate well on a smaller screen. I want my images to scale and allot of the interactive functionally
				will have to be disabled. But I would like to get away with as much interactivity as possible . On desktop, I want to use a modal for contact
			but for mobile, the modal function will be disabled  this will be featured at the bottom of the page. The footer will consist of copyright jargon and links to social network</p>
