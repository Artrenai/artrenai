			<h2>Purpose, Audience, Goal</h2>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Purpose:</strong>To display my work and attract many different types of employers outside the scope of what my portfolio
				showcases.</li>
				<li><strong>Audience:</strong>People who need portriaits,headshots and candid professional photos, Photography and photmanipulation
				for print marketing and Small businesses.</li>
				<li><strong>Goal:</strong>I want to restart my photography and photo editing/manipulation portfolio. Transition from a person who just does this as a hobby
				to a professional who freelances to suppliment income while going to school. I also want to work outside my comfort zone.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Persona</h2>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Company:</strong> Barbers of "A real Barbershop" looking to hire photographer to do professional headshots for their online marketing, to attract
				customers, specializes in urban haircuts. In downtown albequerque.</li>
				<li><strong>Attitudes and Behaviors:</strong> They are an urban barbershop, the only one for miles in downtown albequerque, They only do urbanlike styles which
					may leave some customers confused about what they do if you google them in the <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/5JzujYs4j9F2">Reviews</a> one person commented "Good if your a thug, if not go somewhere else.". Which
				I believe is a reflection of their target demographic not being inline with the demographic of the area they are located in. It bothered them enough to create a <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/t9tAg1kd9kk">new listing address</a>
				and populate it with good reviews. They are really good at what they do for a specific target audience. Even going as far as advertising that they repair work from done by shops that dont understand the demographic and leave customers
				left with less than what they asked for</li>
				<li><strong>Technology:</strong>Computer(pc),Adobe Acrobat, Internet, SmartPhone, DSLR Camera, Natural lighting </li>
				<li><strong>Goal:</strong>The website is convincing enough to hire Me to do their photographer</li>
				<li><strong>Frustrations:</strong>The barbers still have hesitation on whether investing in a photographer is economically sound and its debatable  that their Present social media
				efforts is enough. They need more convincing. </li>
				<li><strong>Goals:</strong> The website needs to be professional enough to show proficiency but welcoming enough to show flexability artisticly for the culture. </li>
				<li><strong>User Story:</strong>I need to be convinced that investing in this photographer will be in the best interest of my company, I also need examples so that i know whats possible
				and how it can best fit my company needs</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Use Case</h2>
			<p>
				I want to reach a broader audience. My photography and art has been at a hault for a while now.Im looking to build a
				website to reintroduce me into the work and showcase the additional web-developer skills i have aquired. I also want to
				make sure that this website shows that I have a grasp on UX/UI design.
